# [1.0.0] - 2020-08-21

## What's New ❗️

The website has been reworked entirely to ensure a good UI/UX. These changes were needed as the website wasn't good looking. We now start a new website based on Bulma Framework which simplifies the development part. As part of the rework, this repository now uses gitflow to ensure a continuity in the development.
